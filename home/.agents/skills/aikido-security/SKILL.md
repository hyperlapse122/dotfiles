## Purpose

Ensure that all first-party code is scanned for security issues whenever code is written or changed.

## Rules

- Always run **aikido_full_scan** on all newly written, generated, added, or modified first-party code.
- Always provide the complete file contents to the scanner.
- If any security issues are reported, apply the fixes using the remediation guidance from Aikido.
- Run **aikido_full_scan** again after fixes to confirm that no issues remain and no new ones were introduced.
- Repeat the fix and rescan cycle until the scan passes with zero issues.
- If the Aikido MCP server is not installed or not running, inform the user to install it using the official setup guide at
