# AGENTS.md

Cross-platform dotfiles for **Windows + macOS + Arch Linux**. Symlinks are managed by [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) invoked via mise-managed `uvx`. Arch hosts are provisioned by [archinstall](https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall).

> **Status**: bootstrapped. Framework is in place; per-app dotfile content is migrated from `~/nix-config` (Home Manager outputs) commit-by-commit.
>
> **NixOS is being decommissioned.** Home Manager-generated outputs (`~/.config/*`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.gnupg/*.conf`, etc.) are imported INTO this repo as the new source of truth. **Once a file is migrated, edit it HERE — never in `~/nix-config/`.** The Nix source tree is being abandoned and will be deleted after Arch Linux migration.

User-facing quickstart belongs in `README.md` (top-level). This file (`AGENTS.md`) is for agents only.

Every top-level directory MUST have its own `README.md` describing what lives there and how it is consumed.

## Hard rules

### dotbot — mise-managed `uvx` only, NEVER install

- The **only** way dotbot is invoked in this repo is `mise exec uv@latest -- uvx dotbot ...`. `uvx` runs the package ephemerally from PyPI, so every machine gets the same dotbot regardless of local Python state. **Do not install dotbot.** Forbidden, all of these:
  - `pip install dotbot`, `pip install --user dotbot`
  - `pipx install dotbot`
  - `uv tool install dotbot` (this is `uv`'s *persistent* install — it is NOT what we want)
  - `brew install dotbot`, `apt install dotbot`, `pacman -S dotbot`, etc.
  - vendoring dotbot's source into this repo or adding a `dotbot/` git submodule (the canonical upstream template uses a submodule — **we deliberately don't**)
- The single canonical invocation: `mise exec uv@latest -- uvx dotbot -d "$REPO_ROOT" -c install.conf.yaml install.<os>.yaml`. Both `install.sh` and `install.ps1` MUST call exactly this; nothing else may run dotbot.
- **Pass both yaml files under a SINGLE `-c` flag.** dotbot's `-c` is argparse `nargs='+'` (not `append`); writing `-c install.conf.yaml -c install.<os>.yaml` silently drops the first file (only the last `-c` wins). Don't change this back.
- The bootstrap scripts MUST NOT install `mise`; users install `mise` themselves before running the scripts. The scripts may only verify that `mise` is available, then use `mise exec uv@latest -- uvx`. **Do not** add a step that installs dotbot itself.
- `install.conf.yaml` MUST start with `defaults: { link: { create: true, relink: true } }` so individual link entries don't have to repeat them.
- Per-OS files exist because dotbot's `if:` directive runs in `$SHELL`, which is unreliable on Windows (requires `bash -c` wrapping and an installed bash). **Do platform-gating via per-OS files, not `if:`.** `if:` is acceptable for finer Unix-only conditionals (per-host gates, optional package presence).
- Forbidden in `link:` blocks: `force: true` — silently overwrites real files. If you truly need destructive behavior, use a `shell:` step that prompts the user.

### Script parity (HARD)

Every script ships in **both** forms or it is broken:

| Surface | Extension | Targets |
|---|---|---|
| POSIX | `.sh` (`#!/usr/bin/env bash`) | macOS + Linux |
| PowerShell | `.ps1` | Windows |

Adding `foo.sh` without `foo.ps1` is a regression. The two MUST behave equivalently for their target platforms; if a feature is impossible on one side, the script SHOULD exit with a clear error rather than silently no-op.

Exception: scripts that are inherently single-platform (e.g. `archinstall/post-install.sh` runs only inside an Arch chroot) MAY skip parity — document the reason in a header comment in the script itself.

### Root-owned config (`/etc/...`)

dotbot has no root mode and no sudo handling. Root-owned files live under `system/<os>/` mirroring their absolute install path:

```
system/linux/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf
              -> /etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/wifi-powersave-off.conf
```

They are installed by a `shell:` step in the matching `install.<os>.yaml`, calling:

```sh
sudo install -D -m <mode> system/<os>/<abs/path> /<abs/path>
```

Use `sudo install -D` (atomically sets mode and creates parents). Do **not** use `cp`+`chmod` (loses ownership/mode atomicity), and do **not** try to express `/etc/...` as a dotbot `link:` (no sudo, dotbot will fail or silently link a user-owned file into a root-owned tree).

The Linux installer discovers files with a recursive glob under `system/linux/etc/`; adding or removing a root-owned config file should not require editing the install script unless the mode is no longer `0644`.

NetworkManager unmanaged-device rules live as split drop-ins under `system/linux/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/`, matching the legacy dotfiles layout. Do not consolidate them into a monolithic `NetworkManager.conf` — that file is intentionally absent from this repo.

### archinstall (Arch Linux only)

- archinstall has **no separate post-install `--script` hook**. The `--script` flag selects the installer flavor (`guided`, `minimal`, ...), not a user post-install step. The actual post-install hook is the `custom_commands` array in `user_configuration.json`. Each entry runs in `arch-chroot` of the new system, after package install and before unmount.
- End the host's `custom_commands` with the dotfiles bootstrap (install `git` and `curl`, clone this repo, run `install.sh`) so the first boot lands on a fully linked system. Keep the same logic in `archinstall/post-install.sh` for re-running outside the installer.
- The JSON schema changes between archinstall releases. **Regenerate with `archinstall --dry-run`** and copy the produced config out of `/var/log/archinstall/`. Don't hand-edit fields you don't understand — legacy keys (`audio_config`, `bootloader`, `!root-password`) still parse, but new configs use the current nested shape (`disk_config`, `bootloader_config`, `auth_config`).
- `user_credentials.json` MUST be gitignored. Only `user_credentials.example.json` lives in git. Same rule for SSH/age/GPG private keys, API tokens, and disk encryption keys — never commit, even briefly.
- Adding a new host MUST go through the [`archinstall-host`](.agents/skills/archinstall-host/SKILL.md) skill. The skill enforces: (1) regenerate via `archinstall --dry-run`, (2) write `archinstall/<hostname>/host-metadata.json` with a DMI fingerprint so `archinstall/test-host.sh --detect` returns the host on its target machine, (3) burnable QEMU validation with UEFI Secure Boot + LUKS + TPM2 via `archinstall/test-host.sh <hostname>` BEFORE the host is considered done.
- `archinstall/inspect-hardware.sh` and `archinstall/test-host.sh` are Linux-only (single-platform exception per "Script parity" above; documented in their headers). No `.ps1` counterparts.

### Documentation sync (HARD)

Every change to repo structure, conventions, or bootstrap flow MUST update, in the same commit:

1. The owning directory's `README.md`.
2. This `AGENTS.md` if the change affects how an agent should work in this repo.
3. The top-level `README.md` if the change is user-visible (new bootstrap step, new supported platform, new prereq).

A commit or PR that adds or removes directories, renames bootstrap entrypoints, or changes platform support without README updates is incomplete and should not merge.

## Bootstrap chain

| From | Command |
|---|---|
| Fresh macOS / Linux | install `mise`, then `./install.sh` (clones if missing, runs mise-managed `uvx dotbot` with shared + OS yaml) |
| Fresh Windows | `.\install.ps1` (same contract, PowerShell) |
| Fresh Arch from ISO | `archinstall --config archinstall/<host>/user_configuration.json --creds archinstall/<host>/user_credentials.json --silent` — `custom_commands` finishes by running `install.sh` inside chroot |
| Re-link after pulling repo | same `install.sh` / `install.ps1`; dotbot's `relink: true` default makes it idempotent |
| Refresh archinstall schema | `archinstall --dry-run`, copy from `/var/log/archinstall/` |

`install.sh` MUST detect OS via `uname -s` (`Darwin` / `Linux`) and pass the matching `install.<os>.yaml` as the second `-c`. `install.ps1` always uses `install.windows.yaml`.

## Common mistakes

- Installing dotbot via `pip`, `pipx`, `uv tool install`, `brew`, or distro package manager. **Always use mise-managed `uvx dotbot`** — ephemeral, no install.
- Adding dotbot as a git submodule or vendoring its source.
- Splitting yaml files across multiple `-c` flags (`-c f1 -c f2`). dotbot's `-c` is `nargs='+'`, so the second `-c` overwrites the first. Use one `-c f1 f2`.
- Committing `user_credentials.json`, SSH/age/GPG private keys, API tokens, or anything else `archinstall/.gitignore` (or root `.gitignore`) is meant to keep out.
- `link: { force: true }` — destroys existing files silently.
- `cp` for `/etc/` files, or `sudo cp` instead of `sudo install -D -m <mode>`.
- Hand-editing archinstall JSON without `archinstall --dry-run` to verify the current schema first.
- Adding `.sh` without matching `.ps1`, or vice versa.
- Adding a top-level directory without a `README.md`, or moving things without updating the layout block in this file.
- Editing migrated files inside `~/nix-config/`. That source tree is being abandoned — edit the copy in this repo's `home/` instead. Re-deriving from `~/nix-config/*.nix` modules is also wrong: those Nix expressions are not the canonical source post-migration.
